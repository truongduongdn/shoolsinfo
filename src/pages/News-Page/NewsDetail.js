                            An investment with potential returns </h2>


                        <p className="textformat"> Universities play a crucial role in providing high-level education, serving as a bridge to transition students from academic environments to the practical "racetrack" of the job market, not only domestically but also globally.

                            Therefore, investing seriously in this level of education is often likened to an investment with high returns.<br />

                            However, it is crucial to consider the cost aspect of high-quality education, which originates standards from well-established education systems worldwide.

                            This concern remains an issue that many parents and students worry about, not only in distant provinces but also in central cities.<br />

                            To ensure the maintenance of quality infrastructure and teaching staff that meet international standards, international universities tend to invest more than usual, approaching the levels seen in foreign institutions in certain aspects.

                            Meanwhile, the average income of Vietnamese citizens still significantly differs from the overall average of people in developed countries.<br />

                            Opportunities for all talents 

                        Understanding the rightful aspirations of parents and students with progressive visions, many international universities have implemented programs to support students in accessing financial aid mechanisms to pursue studies at their institutions.</p>

                        <p className='textformat'>Among these, the British University of Vietnam (BUV) stands out with its annual scholarship fund dedicated to the mission "Here for the Future of Vietnam."

                        According to the school's announcement, the scholarship fund is awarded annually to a diverse range of domestic and international students, with various criteria tailored to each group of candidates.<br />

                        For example, candidates with outstanding academic achievements and rich community engagement experiences would be eligible for the British Ambassador Scholarship.

                        Meanwhile, candidates with excellent academic records and leadership potential will be given priority consideration for the Founder's Scholarship.

                        For those facing difficult circumstances but demonstrating resilience in their academic pursuits, the Lion's Heart Scholarship, symbolizing unwavering support, will accompany them through challenges.

                        <p className="textformat">The Talent Scholarship is a program for talented candidates who have excelled academically and in extracurricular activities, demonstrating outstanding achievements in their fields of expertise.

                        Not confined to academic achievements alone, the scholarship fund is distributed across diverse schools at BUV, including the School of Business, School of Computing and Innovative Technologies, Schools of Communications and Creative Industries, and the School of Hospitality and Tourism, as well as academic levels including bachelor's and master's degrees, catering to candidates with diverse passions.

                        Depending on the candidateâ€™s potential, the scholarship program offers various tiers of tuition fee support, with the highest levels reaching up to 75% or even 100%, equivalent to a billion Vietnamese dongs. The total fund for the year 2024 amounts to over US$3,418.</p>

                        The most outstanding candidates selected by the BUV Scholarship Fund "shine brightly" in the first round of awards in 2024, coming from reputable schools nationwide, including specialized high schools like Hanoi Amsterdam High School, Phan Boi Chau High School (Nghe An), Thai Binh Specialized High School, and Vinh Phuc Specialized High School, at the 12th grade and post-secondary levels.

                        Among them are many students with challenging circumstances who continuously strive for academic excellence.<br />

                        Additionally, there are students with ample material resources, warm hearts, and enthusiasm for social activities, contributing to positive values within the community right from their school days.

                        <p className="textformat">Professor Raymond Gordon, Vice Chancellor and President of the British University Vietnam (BUV), said that they are delighted to see the young talents supported by BUV continue to excel not only academically but also in social activities, aligning with the values that BUV aims to instill.

                            "We aspire to develop highly employable graduates who are first and foremost good human beings with ethics of kindness and caring. They will serve as vibrant testimonials to BUV's commitment to the Vietnamese education system, aiming for a sustainable and prosperous future," he said.

                            The program creates opportunities for talented candidates with outstanding strengths in various fields and different starting points to access international education standards and pursue a premium British degree.

                            <p className="textformat">The British University Vietnam (BUV) awards bachelor's degrees directly from the University of London, Staffordshire University, the University of Stirling, and the Arts University Bournemouth, which are globally recognized institutions.

                                It provides a quality and reputable education system from the UK along with an internationally standardized learning experience for Vietnamese students.

                                The school officially became the first and only university in Vietnam and the Southeast Asia region, one of the 22 universities outside the U.K. to achieve QAA accreditation as an independent education institution.
